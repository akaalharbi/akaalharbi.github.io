# About

I am a ~~first~~ second Year PhD student at [LiP6](https://lip6.fr), [Sorbonne University](https://sciences.sorbonne-universite.fr/) under the supervision of [Charles Bouillaguet](https://lip6.fr/Charles.Bouillaguet/).

My work is on evaluating the cost of parallelizing an algorithm giving its cost in the sequential setting. Along the way, we try to write the best implementation that requires us to pay the least amount of money to a cloud provider (e.g. Amazon) to run the algorithm. Hopefully, the model correspond to the existing cluster settings.
